# Turret cap generator

This openscad model will let you generate you're own turret caps for scopes / red dots that you may have misplaced or lost.  Use customizer to play around with the knurling to find what works for you.  The variables should be pretty self explanitory and if not explore what they do and adjust for your needs.  I've included the stl for the cap on my Bushnell TRS-26 red dot sight.  

I'm going to throw it up on github as well so if you have suggestions let me know and I might update it.

## Notes

No threading on the inside so it's just press fit or maybe heat up the inside and thread on.  Maybe if openscad made threading easier I'd include it.
